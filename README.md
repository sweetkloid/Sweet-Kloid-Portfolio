# Sweet-Kloid Portfolio
Challenge 20

## Description
For this challenge we wanted to create and deploy a react made portfolio. We wanted the about page to have an icon and some information about us. We wanted to be able to click on the navigation tabs at the top and be taken to the corresponding pages. For the portfolio we wanted to be able to see some of the projects completed. When we click on a project image is takes us to that webpage. When we head over to the contact page we are greeted with a form to fill out. If the form is not completed properly the user will get an alert. For know this form does not lead anywhere. When the user clicks the resume button it downloads the resume for the user to look at. At the bottom are icons that lead to the users socials.
